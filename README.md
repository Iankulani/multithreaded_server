# multithreaded_server
multithreaded server. This repository contains a multithreaded server/client application built using C (or another language like Java, C++, etc.). The software demonstrates the ability of the server to handle multiple clients concurrently through the use of threading, allowing for non-blocking operations and efficient resource usage.

Features.
Multithreaded Server. The server can handle multiple incoming client connections simultaneously by spawning new threads for each client. This improves performance and ensures that the server can scale for numerous clients.

Client-Server Communication. Clients connect to the server, send data, and receive responses in real time. Communication is done via sockets using a custom protocol (or HTTP/other protocols, depending on the implementation).

Concurrency Handling. Each client request is processed in a separate thread, allowing other requests to be handled in parallel without blocking the server.

Graceful Shutdown. The server can gracefully handle the shutdown of client connections and clean up resources when required.
